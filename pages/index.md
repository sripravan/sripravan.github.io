I was born on October 27th, 1998 (కార్తీక శుద్ధ సప్తమి, విక్రమాదిత్య శకం 2055) in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. 🎂

Various other initial conditions, many choices, many events and many other factors in and not in the scope of my observation led me to be interested in:

1. Building Software 🧑‍💻
2. Listening to Music 📾🎧 (Carnatic Music and Telugu Movie Melodies == ❤️) 
3. Watching lots of TV shows 📺 and Movies 🎥
4. Playing Video Games 🎮🕹️
5. Reading 📖 (not a book worm 🐛 per say but I do keep reading)

While the topic of [free will is highly debated and nuanced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will), humans do have a [sense of agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_agency).

This sense of agency in my case is guided by 3 principles:

**1. Kindness (driven by empathy)**

_“Don't do unto others what you don't want done unto you.”_ - **Confucius**

**2. Continuous Introspection**

_“Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.”_ ― **C.G. Jung**

**3. Prioritizing the Rocks of Life**
