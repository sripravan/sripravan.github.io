title: Building an SPA in Jekyll
layout: article
---
I have created my personal site and blog using Jekyll while ensuring that it is an SPA and here's how I did it.

I know that there are alternatives to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that already generate an [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) but the problem is that they are too opinionated on which JavaScript framework they use. For example, [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) uses [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and for a simple blog I feel these frameworks are an overkill.

So I decided to stick with Jekyll, my favourite static site generator mostly because of the ability to extend it using plugins that can be written in Ruby.

## Step 1

In all my Jekyll layouts, the main tag contains all the content that changes across different pages. So, I wrote a simple plugin that extracts the content in the main tag and the title tag and generates a JSON using that:

```ruby
Jekyll::Hooks.register :site, :post_write do |site|
  
  Dir.glob(File.join(site.dest, '**/*.html')) do |original_file_path|
    
    raw_file_path = original_file_path.sub(site.dest, File.join(site.dest, 'raw')).sub('.html', '.json')
    raw_file_dir = File.dirname(raw_file_path)
    FileUtils.mkdir_p(raw_file_dir) unless File.exist?(raw_file_dir)
    original_content = File.read(original_file_path)
    raw_content = original_content.split('<main>').last.split('</main>').first
    title = original_content.split('<title>').last.split('</title>').first
    page_data = {
      'title': title,
      'content': raw_content,
    }
    
    File.open(raw_file_path, 'w') do |raw_file|
      raw_file.write(page_data.to_json)
    end
  
  end

end
```

As you can see in the above code, I use [Jekyll Hooks](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/hooks/) to register an event handler for **:post_write** event on the **:site** container. This allows me to extract content site wide after all content manipulations like content minification and save them in a directory called raw.

## Step 2

This content now had to be asynchronously retrieved and had to be displayed. To do that I wrote some simple Vanilla JS that sends an AJAX request, changes the content simply by replacing the **innerHTML** in the **main tag** and changes the title by assigning a new value to **document.title**.

```js
function changeView(location) {
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function () {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
      var data = JSON.parse(xhttp.responseText);
      document.title = data["title"];
      document.querySelector('main').innerHTML = data["content"];
      window.scrollTo(0, 0);
    }
  };
  if (location === '/') {
    location = '/index';
  }
  location = '/raw' + location + '.json';
  console.log(location);
  xhttp.open('GET', location, true);
  xhttp.send();
}
```

## Step 3

Add an event handler to all elements with the class, **local-link** that uses the above **changeView()** function while maintaining URL state with the help of the History API.

```js
document.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
  if (e.target.classList.contains('local-link')) {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (window.location.pathname != e.target.pathname) {
      history.pushState({}, '', e.target.pathname);
      changeView(e.target.pathname);
    }
  }
});
```

Also, I had to write an event handler for the **popstate** event to make sure that the back button works properly.

```js
window.addEventListener('popstate', function (e) {
  changeView(window.location.pathname);
});
```

## Step 4

Obviously, add the **local-link** class to all links local to the website to make sure that all the JS written actually works. üòÅ

## Conclusion

It is not very hard to build an SPA and does not require any fancy JS frameworks. 

P.S. [Turbo][https://turbo.hotwired.dev/] is a much better option for someone who wants to achieve a similar result. Also, my website is no longer an SPA.
