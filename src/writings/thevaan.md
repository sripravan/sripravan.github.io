His advice made the village great, his void made the village a bait.

Ignorance was spread across as he left the village for a toss.

A quest like none other, an inquiry like every other.

With time, he lost his pride. With trees cut down, he lost his hide.

The man was called an impostor as time changed his posture.

Stars in the darkness followed him as they found the man in him.

He advised them now and then but forgot to tell them why and when.

The man who broke men into two as the men who fought who is who.

The men who followed the man that changed, the men who followed the man who changed.

The advice that was lost in here was to never forget to question forever.
