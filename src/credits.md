1. This website was generated using the awesome static site generator called [Lume](https://lume.land/).

2. I also use various Lume plugins which themselves are powered by other softwares:

    a. Code Highlight - [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)

    b. Date - [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)

    c. SASS - [Deno SASS](https://github.com/binyamin/deno-sass)

    d. Minify HTMl - [minify-html](https://github.com/wilsonzlin/minify-html)

3. [Deno](https://deno.com/) which powers Lume and has been greatly helpful with lots of other work.

4. I also used [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) from some of the diagrams in the blog posts.

5. The beautiful icons in the footer are [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)

6. The website is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

And of course, thanks to all the other tools and software that were part of the dependency trees for each of the ones above.
