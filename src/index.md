I am Sri Pravan Paturi, a software engineer currently building in-house tooling for a data engineering / business intelligence team at [Amazon](https://amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/working-at-amazon). My work can largely be described as full-stack development but I also do participate in the deployment and infrastructure management of our products.

Professionally, as a full-time employee at a company I have around 4 years of experience now. However, I learnt about programming for the first time in 6th grade and started seriously working on web development projects since 11th grade even making some occasional money from freelance projects.

I also continue to work on hobby projects like this website outside my work. This experience of building software both in and outside regulated environments has given me a more rounded view of building and maintaining software.

Currently my favourite programming language to work with both at and outside work is [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Especially outside work, [Deno](https://deno.com/) has made it incredibly easy to work with Typescript.

Outside of software engineering, I mostly watch TV shows, movies and occasionally also play games on my PC or [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-IN/consoles/xbox-series-s).

Recently, I have also been delving a bit into writing stories, mostly in English and Telugu.
